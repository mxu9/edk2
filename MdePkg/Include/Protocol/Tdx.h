  If TD-Guest firmware supports measurement and an event is created, TD-Guest
  firmware is designed to report the event log with the same data structure
  in TCG-Platform-Firmware-Profile specification with
  EFI_TCG2_EVENT_LOG_FORMAT_TCG_2 format.

  The TD-Guest firmware supports measurement, the TD Guest Firmware is designed
  to produce EFI_TD_PROTOCOL with new GUID EFI_TD_PROTOCOL_GUID to report
  event log and provides hash capability.
